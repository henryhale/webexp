# Themes

This experiment focuses on the design aspect of developing websites by creating a number of minimal CSS themes that are responsive by default so you don't spend more time on issues like fixing the nav bar's box sizing or position.

## Motivation

While custom styling is a normal practice, it is also okay to apply custom default styles only to all HTML elements just like Normalize or TailwindCSS preset. Themes are meant to ~~magically~~ structure and design your pages basing on a predefined layout and styling format.

For example: the layout of the page(how to arrange the main, header, and footer on the page). A CSS class `centeredxy` on the HTML Body Element may mean that all sections(header,main,footer) will be centered in the middle of the page. Others may include:
- `static` - header, main, footer in flex-column responsive container
- `row` - header on the left side (like sidebar), main in the middle, and footer on the right

...and more there can be.

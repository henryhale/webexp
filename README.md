# WebExp

🔍 _A set of small experimental approaches to future web development._

>:warning: _work in progress_

## Overview

This is an attempt to create new approaches to developing applications by abstracting the common grounds for both future and existing projects.

## Motivation

It is based on the idea: _"What if there was one more level of abstraction on top of the browser? Instead of always coding the same forms, dashboards, contact pages, and more from scratch. How about we have a standard system of common responsive components, layouts and themes for developers to quickly setup thier projects using high-level interfaces?"_

## Experiments

In this repository, each folder represents a different experiment containing a README.md file.

- [Blocks](./blocks/)
- [Commands](./commands/)
- [Themes](./themes/)

## Contributing

Feel free to fork/clone this repository and try these experiments. 
Open a new issue in case of any queries, otherwise a pull request making these approaches better is considered welcome.

No dependencies included but be sure to have TypeScript installed globally when developing or fixing a bug.
